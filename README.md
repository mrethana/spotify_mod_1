# Spotify Song Feature Comparison Web App
###### Mod 1 Project: Analysis of audio features of songs for different genres, artists and tracks.

## Summary
We built an interactive dashboard using Flask and Dash to analyze/visualize the difference between the musical features of 10 different artists (50 songs each) and 5 different genres. The video below shows the functionality of the Dash app:

### Data Gathering and Database Relationships


### Artist Trends
+ On average, Migos' tracks had the highest danceability which wasn't expected, given the other artists in the admittedly limited sample such as Michael Jackson.
+ Average acousticness tended to be fairly low for all sampled artists.



### Genre Findings
+ Characteristics of artists within the same or similar genres varied across time.
+ Michael Jackson and Charlie Puth may both be considered high-profile solo pop artists during their respective generations. However, Jackson's songs tended to be higher in energy and valence.
+ This was also true for Migos and The Notorious B.I.G.
This may reflect different generational preferences in musical style.


### Popular Tracks Trends
+ Top tracks from sampled artists tended to be more high-energy and 'danceable', though the artists were diverse in genre and characteristics. Valence was more evenly distributed.



### Next Steps
+ What characterizes more popular genres, on average, vs less popular genres?
+ Do any features correlate with each other?
+ Do songs with featured artists tend to be more popular than songs with only one artist?
+ Include more artists for within-genre comparisons for a more comprehensive analysis.
+ Explore changes in characteristics for an artist over time (ex: Taylor Swift, Kanye West).
+ Predictive models of genre, based on input feature values or vice versa
+ Analyses across time to understand generational changes in sound preferences, paired with historical events (ex: recessions, presidential elections).
